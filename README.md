# jTweens

Messing about writing a tween library.


## TODO:
 + Add loopProgress and totalProgress??
 + Loops Completed - The number of loops completed
 + Destroy tween?
 + More tween types - to, from, fromTo? any more? Can all be based off delta.
    + From + fromTo tween, should it set the objs from values on tween creation or on start()?
 + onLoop callback?
 + yoyo? How to onLoop callbacks work here?
 + startDelay and endDelay? LoopsDelay? How does that effect yoyo??
